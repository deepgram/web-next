## Before You Begin

If you aren't certain which products your contract includes or if you are interested in adding Hotpepper to your on-premises deployment, please consult a Deepgram Account Representative. To reach one, [contact us](https://deepgram.com/contact-us/)!

You will also need an account on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/), so you can conveniently get the latest Deepgram software and updates.

<Alert type="info">

Naming conventions may mention Dashscript, a previous version of Hotpepper; they are the same tool.

</Alert>

## Installing

Deepgram makes all of its products available through Docker Hub.

1. Log in to your Docker Hub account from one of your servers.
2. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   docker pull deepgram/onprem-dashscript
   ```

## Deploying

Before you can run your on-prem deployment with Hotpepper, you must configure Hotpepper. To do this, you will need to update your Docker Compose and container configuration files, then restart Docker.

### Update Your Docker Compose File

Hotpepper requires paths to four resources:

- Directory that stores the Hotpepper database
- Directory that stores input datasets (collections of audio files to transcribe)
- Directory to which packaged datasets should be output
- Configuration file, which is written in TOML to promote easy human editing

1. To house your Hotpepper database, in your root directory, create a directory named `db`:

    ```bash
    mkdir db
    ```

    <Alert type="info">

    You can name this directory whatever you like, as long as you update the `docker-compose.yml` file accordingly.

    </Alert>


2. To house your input datasets, in your root directory, create a directory named `datasets`:

    ```bash
    mkdir datasets
    ```

    <Alert type="info">

    You can name this directory whatever you like, as long as you update the `docker-compose.yml` file accordingly.

    </Alert>

3. To house your output datasets, in your root directory, create a directory named `packaged`:

    ```bash
    mkdir packaged
    ```

    <Alert type="info">

    You can name this directory whatever you like, as long as you update the `docker-compose.yml` file accordingly.

    </Alert>

4. Add the following to the end of your default `docker-compose.yml` file in your root directory and modify the file to include the appropriate paths:

    ```toml
    # Hotpepper, the on-premises human transcription/labeling tool for creating training
    # sets. (Note: Naming conventions may mention Dashscript, a previous version 
    # of Hotpepper; they are the same tool.)
    dashscript:
      image: deepgram/onprem-dashscript:latest

    # Here we expose the service port to the host machine. The container port
    # (right-hand side) must match the port that the service is listening
    # on (from its configuration file).
    ports:
      - "8081:80"

    # An admin "super-user" must be present in the database to execute user and dataset
    # management actions through the app.  Setting these environment variables will
    # ensure that the app starts with at least one.
    environment:
      DASHSCRIPT_ADMIN_USER: "admin"
      DASHSCRIPT_ADMIN_PASSWORD: "admin_pass"

    volumes:
      # The container paths (right side) should align with those used in the Hotpepper 
      # config file.
      
      # Path to the Hotpepper database directory.  The name of the database will be 
      # pulled from the Hotpepper config file.
      - "/path/to/database:/db"

      # Path to the directory containing input datasets. New datasets are
      # created by adding subdirectories to this folder and placing audio data
      # there.  This directory should be structured like so:
      # /path/to/input/data/
      #    |_ dataset1/
      #      |_ audio1.mp3
      #      |_ audio2.mp3
      #   ...
      - "/path/to/input/data:/datasets"

      # Path to where Hotpepper
      # will save its finalized, packaged datasets.
      - "/path/to/output/data:/packaged"

      # Path to the Hotpepper config file.
      - "/path/to/config/file.toml:/config.toml:ro"

      # Invoke Hotpepper, giving it the path to the config file (in the
      # container).
      command: /config.toml serve
    ```

5. Add the first Hotpepper administrator by configuring the following environment variables in your `docker-compose.yml` file:

      - `DASHSCRIPT_ADMIN_USER`
      - `DASHSCRIPT_ADMIN_PASSWORD`


### Update Your Container Configuration File

1. In your `config` subdirectory in your root directory, create the `config.toml` file:

    ```bash
    cd config
    touch config.toml
    ```

2. Add the following code to the `config.toml` file:

```toml
# The container path to the Hotpepper database. (Note: Naming conventions 
# may mention Dashscript, a previous version of Hotpepper; they are the same tool.)
db = "/db/dashscript.db"

# A directory for storing input datasets (collections of audio files to
# transcribe).
# Path to the directory containing input datasets. New datasets are
# created by adding subdirectories to this folder and placing audio data
# there. This directory should be structured like so:
# /datasets/
#   |_ dataset1/
#      |_ audio1.mp3
#      |_ audio2.mp3
#   ...
datasets = "/datasets"

# A directory for outputting packaged datasets.
packaged_dataset_location = "/packaged"

[server]
  port = 80

# For customers who have ASR enabled, the following configuration will place
# a button "Get ASR" on the L1 transcription page to pre-populate the
# transcript field with ASR.
# Ensure that the endpoint points to your on-premise API instance!
[asr]
   endpoint = "http://api:8080/v2/listen?punctuate=true"  # Docker Compose
```

## Allowing Automatic Transcription

Hotpepper can be configured to allow users labeling at level L1 to submit assigned files to an on-premise Deepgram Speech Engine for automatic speech recognition (ASR) and transcription. When ASR is used, the Hotpepper server sends the assigned audio file to the configured Speech API endpoint, parses a transcript from the results, and automatically populates the Transcript textarea of the labeling view with the returned transcript. In our experience, users value this feature highly when labeling.

In Hotpepper’s `config.toml` file, notice the following lines, which enable ASR:

```toml
# Ensure that the endpoint points to your Speech API instance

[asr]
  # docker compose
  # endpoint = "http://api:8080/v2/listen?punctuate=true"
```

When Hotpepper is properly configured for ASR, the **File Details** area of the Hotpepper labeling view will include a **Get ASR** button.

## Backing up Data

To avoid losing all transcripts produced by Hotpepper, back up both your dataset directories and the Hotpepper database. Hotpepper uses a SQLite database, so you only need to copy the configured database file to a secure location.

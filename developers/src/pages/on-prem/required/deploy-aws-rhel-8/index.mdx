# {frontmatter.title}

Cloud-hosted on-premises (on-prem) deployments are the most common type of deployment performed by customers who want to leverage Deepgram within their own infrastructure. Specific configurations vary, but the Cloud Service Providers that are typically used include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). This guide details steps to set up a deployment to the cloud on an AWS instance running Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8.

Deploying Deepgram on AWS requires some preparation. In this guide, you will learn how to expose and access your application in a secure and stable manner. You will need to perform some of these steps in the AWS Management Console and some in your local terminal.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you will need a Deepgram Account Representative. To reach one, [contact us](https://deepgram.com/contact-us/)!

Your Deepgram Account Representative will guide you through the process of setting up:

- a Deepgram product contract
- a [Deepgram Console account](https://console.deepgram.com/), so we can connect your license to your projects
- an account on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/), so you can conveniently get the latest Deepgram software and updates.

Ahead of your planned on-prem deployment, your Deepgram Account Representative will need:

- your Deepgram Console account email address
- your Deepgram Console Project ID
- your Docker Hub Account ID

Providing this information will allow Deepgram to supply:

- download links to your customized configuration files, which will include your license ID
- download links to required models, including at least one pre-trained AI model for testing purposes

In addition, you will need to [make sure you have a valid RHEL subscription with Red Hat](https://access.redhat.com/management/subscriptions).

## Accessing Your Cloud Environment

AWS uses public-key cryptography to secure login information for your instance. In a Linux instance, password authentication is disabled; you use a key pair to log in to your instance securely.

### Create an Amazon EC2 Key Pair

If you don’t already have an Amazon EC2 key pair, you will need to create one in order to access the AWS EC2 Virtual Machine. To learn how, read [Create a key pair using Amazon EC2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html#having-ec2-create-your-key-pair) in Amazon’s documentation.

<Alert type="info">

Keys must be created in each AWS region in which you will deploy Deepgram on-premises.

</Alert>

At the end of this process, your browser should download a `private-key.pem` file for your key pair. Move this file to a secure and memorable location.

### Create an Amazon EC2 Instance

​To begin your on-prem installation, you must create an Amazon EC2 instance.

#### New AWS Launch Experience

<Alert type="info">

If you're not yet using the new AWS launch experience, [skip to instructions for creating an Amazon EC2 Instance using the old AWS launch experience](#old-aws-launch-experience).

</Alert>

If you're using the new AWS launch experience:

1. Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard and confirm that the proper AWS Region is configured, then choose **Launch Instance** and select **Launch Instance** in the dropdown to open the wizard.

2. Under **Name and Tags**, for **Name**, enter "Deepgram On-Premises (RHEL 8)".

3. For **Applications and OS Images (Amazon Machine Image)**, enter "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8" in the search bar, and search.

4. Next to the **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8** image by **Amazon Web Services** with **Ver Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.6 (HVM)**, click **Select**. In the modal that appears, confirm the latest version of the image is **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.6 (HVM)** or greater, and select **Continue**.

   3. If you intend to use an SSL proxy in conjunction with Deepgram on-premises, select **Allow HTTPS traffic from the internet**.

8. For **Configure storage**, increase the **gp2** Root Volume value to at least **32** GiB. We recommend more if you intend on deploying multiple models, starting at 100 GiB for a [DGTools](/on-prem/optional-components/dgtools) model training environment.

9. For **Summary**, ensure the **Number of instances** value is at least **1** and confirm that the rest of your instance settings are correct. They should consist of the following values:

   - **Software Image (AMI)**: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 ami-08970fb2e5767e3b8
   - **Virtual server type (instance type)**: g4dn.2xlarge
   - **Firewall (security group)**: either **New Security Group** or the name of your selected security group
   - **Storage (volumes)**: 2 volume(s)

   After you have confirmed these values, select **Launch instance**.

10. Once the instance successfully launches, review its Launch log and other "Next Steps", then select **View all instances**.

11. From the list of instances, select your new **Deepgram On-Premises (RHEL 8)**, and make note of or copy its Public IPv4 DNS entry.

1. Open the terminal application for your computer.

2. Connect to your AWS instance:

   ```bash
   ssh -i private-key.pem ec2-user@PUBLIC_IPV4_DNS_VALUE
   ```

   <Alert type="warning">

   Be sure to replace the PUBLIC_IPV4_DNS_VALUE placeholder value with the DNS value for your instance. Also check that the path to your `private-key.pem` file is correct.

   </Alert>

3. If you receive a message that indicates that the authenticity of the host can’t be established, type `yes`, then press the Enter key on your keyboard.

## Configuring Your Cloud Environment

Once you have successfully logged in to your instance, you must remove incompatible kernel drivers and install all of the necessary utilities to run GPU-accelerated containers in Docker.

### Update Red Hat with DNF Package Management Tool

Update the system to RHEL 8.7.

<Alert type="info">

We recommend using the RHEL 8.6 image from the AWS image base because it is more recently updated.

</Alert>

1. Update your AWS instance’s operating system package manager to get information on updated versions of packages or their dependencies:

   ```bash
   sudo dnf update -y
   ```

2. Verify that the update was successful:

   ```bash
   cat /etc/redhat-release
   ```

   You should expect the command to return the following output:

   ```
   >Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 8.7 (Ootpa)
   ```

### Install Podman as the container engine for RHEL 8

Install Podman which is the RHEL 8 native container engine:

10. Test that the NVIDIA drivers and CUDA environment were successfully installed:

   ```bash
   nvidia-smi
   ```

### Setting up the NVIDIA Container Toolkit

<Alert type="info">

This is from the NVIDIA Installation Guide https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html#podman

</Alert>

Install the NVIDIA Container Toolkit

1. Setup the package repository and GPG key:

   ```bash
   distribution=$(. /etc/os-release;echo $ID$VERSION_ID) \
    && curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/libnvidia-container/$distribution/libnvidia-container.repo | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/nvidia-container-toolkit.repo
   ```

2. Install the NVIDIA Container Toolkit:

   ```bash
   sudo dnf clean expire-cache \
    && sudo dnf install -y nvidia-container-toolkit
   ```

3. WGET the RHEL 7 NVIDIA container toolkit

   ```bash
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NVIDIA/dgx-selinux/master/bin/RHEL7/nvidia-container.pp
   ```

4. Add the NVIDIA container to the SELinux policy modules

   ```bash
   sudo semodule -i nvidia-container.pp
   ```

5. List the NVIDIA container kernel modules and restore the security context of those modules

   ```bash
   nvidia-container-cli -k list | restorecon -v -f -
   ```

6. Restore the security context of the contents of `/dev` 

   ```bash
   restorecon -Rv /dev
   ```

7. Test that the NVIDIA Container Toolkit was successfully installed

   ```bash
   sudo podman run --user 1000:1000 --security-opt=no-new-privileges --cap-drop=ALL \
   --security-opt label=type:nvidia_container_t  \
   docker.io/mirrorgooglecontainers/cuda-vector-add:v0.1
   ```

### Run podman as non-root

Modify the NVIDIA container runtime to enable running podman as non-root (a.k.a. "rootless")

1. Edit the `/etc/nvidia-container-runtime/config.toml` file

   ```bash
   sudo vi /etc/nvidia-container-runtime/config.toml
   ```

2. Modify the file contents to match:

   ```
   [nvidia-container-cli]
   #no-cgroups = false
   no-cgroups = true
   # ...
   [nvidia-container-runtime]
   #debug = "/var/log/nvidia-container-runtime.log"
   debug = "~/.local/nvidia-container-runtime.log"
   ```

3. Test rootless podman and the NVIDIA container toolkit/CUDA environment

   ```bash
   podman run --security-opt=no-new-privileges --cap-drop=ALL --security-opt \
   label=type:nvidia_container_t --hooks-dir=/usr/share/containers/oci/hooks.d/ \
   docker.io/nvidia/cuda:10.2-base nvidia-smi
   ```

### Log in to Docker Hub with Podman 

Once you are satisfied that Podman is installed and configured correctly along with the NVIDIA Container Toolkit and the CUDA environment, cache your credentials locally by logging in to Docker Hub. Once your credentials are cached locally, you should not have to log in again (until after you log out (`podman logout`)).

<Alert type="warning">

We recommend that you use an access token when logging in to Docker Hub. Access tokens are used like passwords, but limit administrative access to your account. To learn how to create and use access tokens with Docker, read Docker’s documentation on [Access Tokens](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/access-tokens/).

</Alert>

## Setting up the Deepgram Engine and API Containers

Now that your environment is set up, you can download and set up your Deepgram products. For ease of use, Deepgram provides its products in Docker containers.

### Get Deepgram Products

1. Download the latest Deepgram Engine image from Docker:

   ```bash
   podman pull docker.io/deepgram/onprem-engine:3.45.3
   ```

2. Download the latest Deepgram API image from Docker:

   ```bash
   podman pull docker.io/deepgram/onprem-api:1.88.0
   ```

3. Download the latest Deepgram License Proxy Server image from Docker:

   ```bash
   podman pull docker.io/deepgram/onprem-license-proxy:1.4.0
   ```

### Import Your Container Configuration and Model Files

Before you can run your on-prem deployment, you must configure the required components. To do this, you will need to create a directory for and customize your configuration files, as well as create a directory to house models that have been encrypted for use in your requests.

For your deployment, we provide models and configuration files to you via Amazon S3 buckets, so you can download directly to your AWS RHEL instance. If you don’t have customized configuration files, you can create configuration files using the examples included in [Customize Your Configuration](#customize-your-configuration).

1. To house your configuration files, create a directory named `config`:

   ```bash
   mkdir config
   ```

   <Alert type="info">

   You can name this directory whatever you like, as long as you update the `podman` commands accordingly.

   </Alert>

2. In your new directory, download each TOML configuration file using the links provided by Deepgram:

   ```bash
   cd config
   wget LINK_TO_TOML_CONFIGURATION_FILE_PROVIDED_BY_DEEPGRAM
   ```

   <Alert type="warning">

   Be sure to replace each LINK_TO_TOML_CONFIGURATION_FILE_PROVIDED_BY_DEEPGRAM placeholder value with the URL to the TOML configuration file provided by your Deepgram Account Representative.

   </Alert>

3. To house models that have been encrypted for use in your requests, create a directory named `models`:

   ```bash
   mkdir models
   ```

   <Alert type="info">

   You can name this directory whatever you like, as long as you update the `podman` command and `engine.toml` file accordingly.

   </Alert>

5. In your new directory, download each model using the links provided by Deepgram:

   ```bash
   cd models
   wget LINK_TO_MODEL_PROVIDED_BY_DEEPGRAM
   ```

   <Alert type="warning">

   Be sure to replace each `LINK_TO_MODEL_PROVIDED_BY_DEEPGRAM` placeholder value with the URL to the model provided by your Deepgram Account Representative.

   </Alert>

### Customize Your Configuration

Once your configuration files have been created in your AWS instance, you can update your configuration to customize it for your use case.

#### Configuration Files

<Alert type="warning">

Your Deepgram Account Representative should provide you with download links to customized configuration files. Unless further customized, the example files included in this section are basic and should be used only to spin up a standard proof of concept (POC) deployment or to test your system.

</Alert>

##### `api.toml`

The API configuration file determines how the API container built from the Docker image will be run. It includes important settings for exposing API endpoints and for enabling features and post-processing plugins for requests.

```

## Starting and Using Your Container

To make sure your Deepgram on-prem deployment is properly configured and running, you will want to start the containers with Podman, and make a sample request to Deepgram.

### Start Podman

Now that you have your configuration files set up and in the correct location to be used by the container, use Podman to run the containers:

1. Navigate to your home directory where you created `./config` and `./models`

```bash
cd ~
```

2. Start License Proxy

<Alert type="info">
Be sure to replace the `LICENSE_KEY` placeholder in this command with your Deepgram provided license key.
</Alert>

```bash
podman run --rm -d --name deepgram-onprem-license-proxy --network=host \
  docker.io/deepgram/onprem-license-proxy:1.4.0 -v serve \
  --license-key "LICENSE_KEY" --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8443 --status-port 8089
```

3. Verify that License Proxy started properly

```bash
podman container logs deepgram-onprem-license-proxy
```

4. Start Engine

```bash
podman run --security-opt=no-new-privileges --cap-drop=ALL --security-opt \
  label=type:nvidia_container_t --hooks-dir=/usr/share/containers/oci/hooks.d/ \
  --rm -d --name deepgram-onprem-engine --network=host \
  -v ./config:/config:z -v ./models:/models:z \
  docker.io/deepgram/onprem-engine:3.43.4 -v serve /config/engine.toml
```

5. Verify that Engine started properly

```bash
podman container logs deepgram-onprem-engine 
```

6. Start API

```bash
podman run --rm -d --name deepgram-onprem-api --network=host -v ./config:/config:z \
  docker.io/deepgram/onprem-api:1.83.0 \
  -v serve /config/api.toml
```  

7. Verify that API started properly

```bash
podman container logs deepgram-onprem-api
```

### Test Your Deepgram Setup with a Sample Request

Test your environment and container setup with a local file:

```bash
curl -X POST -T FILE_PATH http://localhost:8080/v1/listen
```

Finally, test that you can view the model that was automatically loaded by Deepgram Engine. To do this, download the American English Harvard Sentences file from the [Open Speech Repository](https://www.voiptroubleshooter.com/open_speech/index.html) and run it through the model:

```bash
wget https://www.voiptroubleshooter.com/open_speech/american/OSR_us_000_0019_8k.wav

curl -X POST --data-binary @OSR_us_000_0019_8k.wav "http://localhost:8080/v2/listen?model=general-dQw4w9WgXcQ&version=2021-08-18"; echo
```

## Adding the License Proxy Server

For customers deploying Deepgram’s on-premises solution in production, Deepgram recommends the License Proxy Server, which is a caching proxy that communicates with the Deepgram-hosted license server to ensure uptime and simplify network security.

<Alert type="warning">

If you aren't certain which products your contract includes or if you are interested in adding the License Proxy Server to your on-premises deployment, please consult a Deepgram Account Representative. To reach one, [contact us](https://deepgram.com/contact-us/)!

</Alert>

There are many benefits of using the License Proxy Server:

- For production deployments, the License Proxy Server allows your deployed on-premises services to continue to run even if your deployment loses connectivity to the Deepgram license server.

- If network security requirements dictate that traffic over the web is allowed from only certain hosts, the License Proxy Server can be deployed statically while ASR services scale elastically.

- If your customers will deploy Deepgram software as part of your on-premises solution and their traffic must flow back to your environment, you may deploy the License Proxy Server to relay traffic on to the Deepgram license server.

To see an architecture overview or learn about monitoring the License Proxy Server, see [License Proxy Server](/on-prem/optional-components/license-proxy-server/).

### Installing

Deepgram makes all of its products available through Docker Hub.

1. Log in to your Docker Hub account from one of your servers.
2. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   $ podman pull docker.io/deepgram/onprem-license-proxy:1.4.0 
   ```

### Deploying

Before you can run your on-prem deployment with the License Proxy Server, you must configure the License Proxy Server. To do this, you will need to update your Docker Compose and container configuration files, then restart Docker.

#### Update Your Container Configuration Files

In your `api.toml` and `engine.toml` files, add a line that specifies the URL to your deployed proxy immediately below your license key configuration:

```toml
[license]
key = "YOUR_LICENSE_KEY"
server_url = "https://localhost:8443"
```

#### Restart Docker

Restart Docker to begin directing licensing requests through the proxy:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

After restarting, test that an ASR request is processed as expected.
